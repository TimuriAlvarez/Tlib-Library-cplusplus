## TLib Library
Year and term: 2nd year, 3rd term.

Subject: Program Design and Programming Languages

## What the heck is that?
This is the library I included in all my Labs that term. It contains plenty of really useful templates, functions and structures, and (of course) no comments... So good luck with this. I hope it will be as helpful for you as it was for me.

TLib Library has two branches:
	1.	tlib, where I put all my finished ideas;
	2.	tdev, aka "unfinished ideas" which you can finish yourself

## What and how you should include
I recommend including all the headers at once. For this purpose there are files "tlib" and "dev":

```
#include "tlib"
#include "tdev"
```

Of course, the lines below won't work in your project. The trick is you have to specify either absolute or relative path to these files, for example:

```
#include "~/Downloads/Tlib Library/tlib"
#include "../../Tlib Library/tdev"
```

Of course, you are free to include headers one by one, but come on what did I make those files for?

## Installation
You don't need to install it at all, all you need is to download the whole repository. Then you can open source code files and compile them. I personaly recommend using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or newer on Windows OS.
